- **Deep Learning** -
- **Neurosymbolic Systems** - The unification of AI (neural networks/ml) with symbolic reasoning frameworks/systems (KGs, inferencing). Combines statistical patterns with constraints and knowledge to improve the representation, reasoning, and generalization of concepts of AI, to solve real world problems.
- **Symbolic Systems** -
- **Neural Network** -
- **System 1 Thinking** - Fast, unconscious, non-verbal inference.
- **System 2 Thinking** - Slow, deliberate, verbal reasoning.
- **Implicit Knowledge** - Representations learned from data
- **Explicit Knowledge** - Human-interpretable rules and knowledge.
- **Black Box** - non-transparent computation.
- **Interpretable** - Structured reasoning.
- **Symbol Emergence** - A symbol being identified from data, becoming a useful discrete concept to be communicated, according to some pre-defined utility measure. Facilitates the establishment of a shared vocabulary.
- **Symbol Grounding Problem** - Endowing agents with the means to autonomously create internal representations that link their manipulated symbols to corresponding referents in the external world.
